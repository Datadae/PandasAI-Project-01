# **Data Analysis of Ecommerce Retail Business utilizing Python PandaAI library and OpenAI**

# **Project Description**

In this project, I conducted an in-depth exploration of an E-commerce Customer Behavior and Purchase Dataset using Python within Jupyter Notebooks. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Pandas and Pandas AI (specifically its large language model).I uncoverd insights, patterns, and trends within the data, ultimately aiming to gain a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior in the E-commerce domain.

## **About Dataset**
The "E-commerce Customer Behavior and Purchase Dataset" is a synthetic dataset generated using the Faker Python library.
It simulates a comprehensive e-commerce environment, capturing various aspects of customer behavior and purchase history within a digital marketplace.
This dataset has been designed for data analysis and predictive modeling in the field of e-commerce.
It is suitable for tasks such as customer churn prediction, market basket analysis, recommendation systems, and trend analysis.

Note: "The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.com and belongs to the original data providers. 
I have used it with the intention of research and give full credit to Kaggle.com and the data creators."

## **Roadmap**
1. Installed the required list of packages.
2. Imported required libraries into python environment namely "Pandas and Pandas AI" 
3. Explored the dataset and performed the required transformation(changed data type and extracted D/M/Y into new columns).
4. Performed various analysis like (Payment analysis, Purchase Behavior Analysis, Return Behavior Analysis and Loyal and Retention Analysis) 
5. Created visualization using various charts.
